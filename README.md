3. Extract important keywords and industry terminology from the job description
4. Generate specific text replacements that you can copy directly into your resume

- Choose a subscription plan (Basic or Premium)

### Step 2: Prepare Your Materials
- Have your resume ready in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format

#### Skills to Add or Highlight

## Making the Changes

For each recommendation, you'll see:

```
ORIGINAL: "What's currently in your resume" (or where to add new content)
REPLACEMENT: "Exactly what to write instead"
```

Simply copy the replacement text and paste it into your resume in place of the original text. If the recommendation indicates adding new content, insert it in the appropriate section.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be comprehensive**: Upload your complete resume and the full job description
2. **Review critically**: Use the recommendations as a guide but maintain your authentic voice
3. **Quantify achievements**: Where possible, include numbers that demonstrate your impact
4. **Customize for each application**: Run the analysis for each job you apply to
5. **Maintain readability**: Don't overload your resume with keywords at the expense of flow

## Technical Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- **OpenAI API errors**: Check your API key and billing status at OpenAI
- **File upload problems**: Ensure your resume is in PDF, DOCX, or TXT format
- **No recommendations generated**: Make sure both your resume and the job description contain sufficient content
